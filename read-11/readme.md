## Audio, Video, Images:

## HTML5 video and audio:
 > * The \<video> and \<audio> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. 

## The HTMLMediaElement API:
 > * Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmaticallyâ€” for example HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), etc. This interface is available to both \<audio> and \<video> elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. 

## Images:
 > * Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

## Controlling sizes of images in CSS:
 > * You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
