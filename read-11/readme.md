## Audio, Video, Images:

## HTML5 video and audio:
 > * The \<video> and \<audio> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. 

## The HTMLMediaElement API:
 > * Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmaticallyâ€” for example HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), etc. This interface is available to both \<audio> and \<video> elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. 

## Images:
 > * Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

## Controlling sizes of images in CSS:
 > * You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

## Aligning images using CSS:
 > * In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it. 

## Centering images Using CSS:
 > * By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block. 

## Background Images
 > * *background-image*
 > * The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

## Repeating Images
 > * background-repeat: 
  > * property can have four values:
   > * repeat:  The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
   > * repeat-x:  The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
   > * repeat-y:  The image is repeated vertically only.
   > * no-repeat: The image is only shown once.

 > * background-attachment:
  > * The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:
   > * fixed:  The background image stays in the same position on the page.
   > * scroll:  The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

## Background Position:.
 > * When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. 

## shorthand:
 > * *background*:
  > * The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

## Image Rollovers & Sprites
 > * Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it. 

## CSS3: Gradients
 > * *background-image*:
  > * CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax. 

## Contrast of background images:
 > * If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.


## Images Summary:
 > * You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
 > * Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
 > * You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. 
 > * Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
 > * You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
 > * To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Practical Information:
 
## Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

## How to Identify Keywords and Phrases:

## Domain Names & Hosting:

 > * WEB HOSTING:
  > * So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested. 

## FTP & Third Party Tools:
 > * To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol. 
 > * As the name suggests, File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site. 

## PRACTICAL INFORMATION SUMMARY:
 > * Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines. 
 > * Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
 > * To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
 > * FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
 > * Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

## Flash, Video & Audio 
 > * Flash is a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to websites. This chapter begins by looking at how to use it in your web pages.
 > * Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.
 > * Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
